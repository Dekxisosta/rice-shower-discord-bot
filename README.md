## Description
A modular and scalable Discord bot framework built with Python and discord.py.
Designed for easy extension with commands and events, centralized logging, and a clean project structure.
Currently in early development; some package structure and features may change as the project evolves.


## What's new?
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Autoloader System** | Automatically loads commands and events from designated folders. Add new functionality simply by creating a file—no need to modify core bot code. Perfect for modular development and quick iteration. |
| **Centralized Logging** | Key bot events—like startup, loaded modules, and command execution—are printed to the console, while all activity, including Discord’s internal logs, is written directly to a log file. This ensures important runtime information is visible immediately, while detailed logs are preserved for debugging, monitoring, and auditing. |
| **Customizable Configuration** | Easily configure command prefixes, intents, tokens, and logging behavior via centralized settings. Supports multiple environments with minimal changes. |
| **Extensible Utilities** | Includes helper modules for logging, autoloading, and other common tasks, making it easy to build additional features or integrate external APIs. |
